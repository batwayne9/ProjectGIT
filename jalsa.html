## GIT Project ##

# Installation

  - yum install git           #installing git
  - git --version             #Checking git installed or not. if installed it shows a version.

 After Successfully installed now we need to setup some global configuration vairables. Now these variables are imp b.coz
 if u r working with othr developers then they need to know who is checking the code in & out and making changes and 
 things like that so this is a way to add ur name to all of ur check-ins and code changes.
  
# Set Config Values

  - git config --global user.name "batwayne9"
  - git config --global user.email "batwayne9@gmail.com"  

  - git config --list         #To Check those values
  
  - git config --global color.ui auto  #To enable colorization of Command line

# Cloning a Remote REPO

  - git clone <url>
     
# Viewig information about the remote repo

  - git remote -v 
     now you can see its lists the information to the repo

  - git branch -a
     it shows the lists of all branches in the repo

  - git commit -m "message"
     commit these changes to repo.

  - git pull origin master
     we're now working on a project that could potentially have multiple developers and people
     hav been pushing their code to that remote repo. while we've been working in our features.
     so if we hit above command, it shows any changes that have been made since the last time 
     that we pulled from that repo.
